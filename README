This sample demonstrates initialisation of the SEGA Saturn hardware, blanking
the screen, and reading input from the gamepad.

Until noted; this sample will not use any libraries from the SEGA Saturn SDK,
as they have not yet been authored.

Currently, there is no provided IP.BIN file.  An IP Maker tool is being created
to facilitate the generation of IP.BIN.
